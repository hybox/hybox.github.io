At this moment in time, the Digital Public Library of America,
Stanford University Libraries, and DuraSpace wish to express again our
deep gratitude to the <a href="https://www.imls.gov/">Institute of
Museum and Library Services (IMLS)</a> for generously funding the
Hydra-in-a-Box project. As recipients of the largest single IMLS award
to date ($2M), these three diverse but mission-aligned organizations
are able to create Hyku, a turnkey and open source software repository
solution, now under development. Hyku will help institutions of all
kinds and sizes by making it easier and more affordable to collect,
manage, publish, and preserve digital content such as publications,
data and research outputs, and all manner of media collections. Our
work on this technology aims to serve humanity by promoting research
and learning in all disciplines, in all languages, in all corners of
the globe. Preserving and promoting access to information makes
possible new discoveries in the sciences, the humanities, and the
arts. It is through such discoveries that we as a civilization attain
a greater understanding of the human condition, that we are able to
cure disease and prolong lives, that we can protect the vitality of
our planet, that we build cultural awareness and harmony, enriching
our collective experience.

The potential to create and discover starts with opportunity. Thank
you, IMLS, for providing us &mdash; and so many other beneficiaries of your
programs &mdash; the opportunity to play a participatory role in this truly
human endeavor.
